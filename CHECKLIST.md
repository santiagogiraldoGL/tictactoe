# Tic Tac Toe — Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **Grid**: 3×3 playable grid; each cell is clickable and shows nothing until played.
- [x] **Turns**: X and O alternate; first move is X. Status text shows whose turn it is (e.g. "X's turn").
- [x] **Win**: When a player gets three in a row (row, column, or diagonal), game ends and status shows the winner (e.g. "X wins!").
- [x] **Draw**: When all 9 cells are filled and there is no winner, status shows a draw (e.g. "Draw!").
- [x] **No moves after game over**: Clicks do nothing once there is a winner or a draw.
- [x] **No overwrite**: Clicking an already filled cell does nothing.
- [x] **Restart**: A restart/play-again control clears the board and allows a new game (X goes first).
- [x] **No frameworks**: Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only; no external libraries.
- [x] **JS size**: `app.js` is roughly under ~150 lines.
